# reopen_spread

Let's see how reopen affects COVID-19 spread.
the reopen data should be strongly correlated with mobility data
available from https://www.gstatic.com/covid19/mobility/Global_Mobility_Report.csv
and spread data is available from https://raw.githubusercontent.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19/master/csse_covid_19_data/csse_covid_19_daily_reports/
so by associating these two data set, we will be able to find correlation between mobility and spread
